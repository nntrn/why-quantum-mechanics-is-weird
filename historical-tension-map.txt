# Major Players: Tension Map

## High Tension (Felt the Conflict)

Heisenberg
* Wrestles with: Being misread vs being understood
* Math says: Only transitions observable
* Claims: "Practical recipe" (admits limited certainty)
* Tension: Knows it's motion-first, uses identity-first to communicate, never reconciles this, late career returns to motion-first philosophy
* Pattern: Sacrifices purity for accessibility, regrets it implicitly

Bohr
* Wrestles with: Cannot articulate what he sees
* Math says: Incompatible measurement contexts
* Claims: "Complementarity" (vague, avoids certainty claims)
* Tension: Sees motion-first structure, lacks vocabulary, uses identity-first words anyway, frustrated by own inability to be clear
* Pattern: Understands deeply, communicates poorly, becomes oracle

Born
* Wrestles with: Math vs physical intuition
* Math says: |ψ|² is probability from measurement
* Claims: "Probability interpretation" (explicitly uncertain)
* Tension: Correct motion-first insight, immediately dismissed by identity-first physicists, watches his insight get buried in identity-first language
* Pattern: Right answer, no cultural power, doesn't fight hard enough

Schrödinger
* Wrestles with: Hates his own equation's implications
* Math says: ψ evolves deterministically, |ψ|² probabilistic
* Claims: ψ IS physical wave (over-certain, then retracts)
* Tension: Wanted identity-first, math forced motion-first, created cat paradox to show identity-first fails, never accepted motion-first
* Pattern: Internal contradiction he never resolved, died frustrated

Einstein
* Wrestles with: Math works but "can't be complete"
* Math says: Predictions accurate, correlations violate classical bounds
* Claims: "God doesn't play dice" (demands certainty QM doesn't provide)
* Tension: Accepts math, rejects interpretation, demands identity-first must exist underneath, knows he's losing argument but can't abandon position
* Pattern: Consistency over correctness, ideological commitment

Bell
* Wrestles with: Proved identity-first impossible, prefers identity-first anyway
* Math says: No local hidden variables possible
* Claims: "Proved something fundamental" (correct certainty)
* Tension: Theorem proves motion-first required, personally prefers Bohm (identity-first rescue), aware of irony
* Pattern: Honest about what math says vs what he wants

Everett
* Wrestles with: Correct physics, insane ontology
* Math says: No collapse needed, just entanglement
* Claims: "All branches exist" (excess certainty about ontology)
* Tension: Eliminated collapse correctly (motion-first), added branch ontology (identity-first rescue), created new interpretation problem while solving old one
* Pattern: Fixed one thing, broke another, didn't see the trade-off

Zeh/Zurek (Decoherence)
* Wrestles with: Found mechanism, still uses wrong language
* Math says: Environment forces rapid resolution
* Claims: "Solves measurement problem" (over-certain) vs "Doesn't solve it" (under-certain)
* Tension: Discovered motion-first mechanism, presented in identity-first language ("destroys coherence"), debate continues because framing still wrong
* Pattern: Right mechanism, wrong vocabulary

## Medium Tension (Uncomfortable but Functional)

Pauli
* Wrestles with: Wants rigor but respects mystery
* Math says: Exclusion principle, spin
* Claims: "Don't ask what electron IS" (appropriately uncertain)
* Tension: Sees identity-first questions are wrong, tells others to shut up about them, but doesn't provide alternative framing
* Pattern: Intellectually honest gatekeeper

Dirac
* Wrestles with: Math is beautiful, interpretation is ugly
* Math says: Relativistic spinor equation
* Claims: "Shut up and calculate" (refuses certainty claims)
* Tension: Makes beautiful math, actively avoids interpretation, sees debates as waste of time
* Pattern: Escapes tension by ignoring it

Feynman
* Wrestles with: Knows it works, doesn't know what it means
* Math says: Path integral equivalent to Schrödinger
* Claims: "Nobody understands QM" (admits universal uncertainty)
* Tension: Brilliant calculator, terrible interpreter, comfortable with not knowing, uses identity-first language because convenient
* Pattern: Pragmatic acceptance of confusion

von Neumann
* Wrestles with: Rigorous math, sloppy interpretation
* Math says: Two evolution types (unitary + collapse)
* Claims: "Measurement is fundamental process" (too certain about wrong thing)
* Tension: Formalized the problem instead of solving it, made identity-first look mathematically necessary, didn't see he'd created confusion
* Pattern: Mathematical rigor masks conceptual error

## Low Tension (Comfortable with Position)

De Broglie
* Wrestles with: Nothing (early), then abandons position
* Math says: λ = h/p for particles
* Claims: "Matter has wavelength" (identity-first, certain)
* Tension: None initially, later tries pilot wave with Bohm, gives up
* Pattern: Early insight, later confused, doesn't fight

Planck
* Wrestles with: Nothing (accepts revolution reluctantly)
* Math says: E = nhν
* Claims: "Just a mathematical trick" (appropriate uncertainty)
* Tension: None, knows he doesn't understand it, okay with that
* Pattern: Conservative, admits limits

Sommerfeld
* Wrestles with: Nothing (teacher, not revolutionary)
* Math says: Fine structure formula
* Claims: Extends Bohr's model (identity-first, certain about extensions)
* Tension: None, happy to work within framework
* Pattern: Consolidator, not questioner

## Zero Tension (True Believers)

Bohm
* Wrestles with: Nothing (committed to identity-first)
* Math says: Can reproduce QM with hidden variables + non-local wave
* Claims: "Particles HAVE definite positions always" (maximum certainty)
* Tension: Zero - knows it's complex, doesn't care, identity-first is non-negotiable
* Pattern: Ideological commitment to identity-first regardless of cost

Deutsch (Many-Worlds)
* Wrestles with: Nothing (certain Many-Worlds is correct)
* Math says: Unitary evolution only
* Claims: "All branches exist, this is obviously right" (maximum certainty)
* Tension: Zero - sees interpretation as solved, dismisses alternatives
* Pattern: Evangelical certainty

QBists (Fuchs, Caves, Schack)
* Wrestles with: Nothing (certain it's about beliefs)
* Math says: ψ is subjective probability assignment
* Claims: "ψ represents agent's beliefs" (certain but wrong level)
* Tension: Zero - comfortable with radical position, too far into subjectivity
* Pattern: Overcorrection to motion-first (into pure subjectivism)

Wheeler
* Wrestles with: Everything is information (but certain about it)
* Math says: Delayed choice experiments
* Claims: "It from bit" (certain but vague)
* Tension: Moderate - knows something deep is happening, can't quite articulate it, throws out provocative ideas without rigorous follow-through
* Pattern: Mystic clarity

Wigner
* Wrestles with: Nothing (certain consciousness matters)
* Math says: Measurement causes collapse
* Claims: "Consciousness causes collapse" (excess certainty)
* Tension: Zero - committed to consciousness role, doesn't question it
* Pattern: Philosophical certainty overwhelming evidence

## Certainty Audit

```
Certainty Gap = Claimed certainty - Math certainty
```

### Negative gap (under-claiming)

* Bohr: Math certain about incompatibility, claims vague complementarity
* Feynman: Math certain about predictions, claims "nobody understands"
* Born: Math certain about probability, claims limited to observations

### Zero gap (aligned)

* Pauli: "Don't ask what IS" matches math's operational structure
* Dirac: "Shut up and calculate" matches math's predictive certainty
* Bell: "Hidden variables impossible" matches theorem

### Positive gap (over-claiming)

* Schrödinger: Math says probabilistic, claims ψ IS physical wave
* Einstein: Math says correlations, claims "incomplete"
* Bohm: Math says predictions, claims particles HAVE positions
* Everett: Math says no collapse, claims all branches EXIST
* Wigner: Math says measurement, claims consciousness CAUSES
* Deutsch: Math says unitary, claims parallel universes EXIST
* von Neumann: Math says incompatible evolution types, claims measurement IS fundamental

### Patterns

High tension correlates with:
* Being present at formulation (1925-1930)
* Understanding math deeply
* Seeing gap between math and language
* Caring about interpretation

Low tension correlates with:
* Joining later (post-1950)
* Ideological commitment
* Either: Not caring about interpretation OR being certain about interpretation

> [!NOTE]
> * Those who felt most tension made biggest contributions (Heisenberg, Bohr, Born)
> * Those who felt least tension caused most confusion (Bohm, Deutsch, Wigner)
> * Those who escaped tension by calculation (Dirac, Feynman) were wisest

### Certainty pattern

```
* Motion-first advocates:  
Under-claim certainty (Bohr, Born, Feynman)

* Identity-first advocates:  
Over-claim certainty (Bohm, Deutsch, Wigner)
```

## Short-term/Long-term Tradeoffs

Motion-first: 
```
* short term value drops 
  (Bohr incomprehensible, Born dismissed)
* long-term truth currency
  (decoherence, quantum info vindicate it)
```

Identity-first:
```
* short term acceptance + immediate grasp
  (Schrödinger won, Bohm has followers)
* long term distortion
  (interpretations multiply, consensus impossible)
```
